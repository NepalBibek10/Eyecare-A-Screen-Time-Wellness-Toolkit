# Eyecare-A-Screen-Time-Wellness-Toolkit
The 20-20-20 Rule: This is a simple and effective technique to help alleviate eye strain, dryness, and fatigue that can occur from prolonged screen use. The rule encourages you to take regular breaks and refocus your eyes. Here's how it works:<br>
Every 20 Minutes: While working or using a screen, set a timer or make a conscious effort to take a break every 20 minutes. This break doesn't need to be long; just a few seconds will do.
<br>
Look at Something 20 Feet Away: During your 20-second break, shift your gaze from the screen to an object that is at least 20 feet (about 6 meters) away. This distance is considered the optimal range for relaxing your eye muscles.
<br>
Repeat: After the 20-second break, you can resume your screen-related tasks. Continue to follow the 20-20-20 rule throughout your screen time session.
